## Description 


 The project is the beginning stages of a blogging application. Unfortunately, I couldn't get it all figured out in time. The app was to be deployed online but that failed as well. 

Work completed:
- Used terminal to install the node_modules package for mysql2, express and inquirer.
- Required Mysql2 to produce necessary functionality
- Required Express to produce necessary functionality
- Required Inquirer to produce necessary functionality
- Organized the Routes in order to connect data.


## Usage 

Functions online when fully deployed.
